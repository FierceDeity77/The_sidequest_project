# The SideQuest: A Centralized Gaming Community Platform

The SideQuest is a full-stack web application inspired by platforms like Reddit, Steam, GameFAQs, GameSpot, IGN, and Fextralife.  
It brings together community discussions, game information, reviews, guides, and user-generated content into one centralized hub.

# Community-Centered Around Games

The SideQuest is a community-driven platform where every game has its own main community, called a Hub. Within each Hub, users can create Taverns, 
which are sub-communities associated with that game. This structure ensures that discussions, guides, and content stay organized around each
game while fostering rich, interconnected communities.

## ⭐ Why I Built This Project

This project solves a real problem I personally dealt with as a gamer:

Whenever I wanted to look for gaming-related content, I needed to open multiple websites:

- Reddit for discussions
- Steam, GameFAQs, and GameSpot for reviews
- IGN and GameSpot for gaming news
- Fextralife, GameFAQs, and Steam for guides and walkthroughs

I wanted one centralized platform where all of these could exist together a single go-to site for all gaming needs.

That is why I built SideQuest:

- To solve my own personal frustration
- To challenge myself as a developer
- To create a strong portfolio project
